# Complete Beginner's Guide to Merchant Management System 🎓

## Part 1: The Basics First 📚

### What is a Web Application? 🌐
- It's like a website that does more than just show information
- Think of Facebook: you can post, like, comment - that's a web application
- Our project is a web application for store owners

### What is an API? 🔌
- API stands for Application Programming Interface
- Think of it as a waiter in a restaurant:
  - You (the customer) don't go to the kitchen (database)
  - You tell the waiter (API) what you want
  - The waiter brings it to you
- Our project is a REST API (a specific way of organizing these requests)

## Part 2: The Technologies We Use 🛠️

### 1. Java & Spring Boot 🍃
- Java: A programming language (like English is a language)
- Spring Boot: A framework (like a set of tools) that helps us build applications faster
- Why we use it:
  - Very reliable
  - Lots of built-in features
  - Used by many big companies

### 2. PostgreSQL Database 🐘
- A place to store information (like a giant Excel spreadsheet)
- Why we use it:
  - Can store lots of data
  - Very reliable
  - Good at handling relationships between data

### 3. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) 🎟️
- A way to create secure "passes" for users
- Like a special bracelet at a water park:
  - Proves you paid
  - Has your information
  - Only works for that day

### 4. Maven 🏗️
- A tool that helps us:
  - Get all the pieces we need
  - Build our application
  - Like a recipe book and kitchen combined

## Part 3: Project Structure Explained 🏗️

### The Layers (Like Floors in a Building)

1. **Controllers (Top Floor)** 📞
   - Where requests first arrive
   - Like a receptionist who:
     - Takes your request
     - Sends it to the right department
     - Returns the response

2. **Services (Middle Floor)** ⚙️
   - Where the actual work happens
   - Like different departments in an office:
     - AuthenticationService: Handles logins
     - MerchantService: Handles store information
     - JwtService: Creates and checks special passes

3. **Repositories (Ground Floor)** 💾
   - Talks to the database
   - Like filing clerks who:
     - Store information
     - Find information
     - Update information

4. **Models (The Blueprint)** 📋
   - Defines what information we store
   - Like a form with fields:
     - Store name
     - Email
     - Password
     - etc.

## Part 4: How It All Works Together 🎭

### Registration Process (Step by Step)

1. **User Sends Registration Info**
   ```json
   {
     "businessName": "My Store",
     "email": "store@email.com",
     "password": "secret123"
   }
   ```

2. **Controller Receives It**
   - Checks if all required information is there
   - Like a receptionist checking if a form is complete

3. **Service Processes It**
   - Checks if email is already used
   - Encrypts the password (makes it secret)
   - Creates new store record

4. **Database Stores It**
   - Saves all the information
   - Gives the store a unique number (ID)

5. **Response Sent Back**
   - User gets their special key (JWT token)
   - Like getting their library card

### Login Process 🔑

1. **User Sends Login Info**
   ```json
   {
     "email": "store@email.com",
     "password": "secret123"
   }
   ```

2. **System Checks**
   - Is email registered?
   - Is password correct?
   - Like checking if your library card is valid

3. **If Successful**
   - Gets a new special key (JWT token)
   - Can now access their information

## Part 5: Security Features 🔒

### Password Protection
- Passwords are never stored as-is
- They're encrypted (scrambled) using BCrypt
- Even we can't see the actual password

### JWT Security
- Every request needs a token
- Tokens expire after some time
- Like a movie ticket:
  - Has your information
  - Only works for that show
  - Can't be reused tomorrow

## Part 6: How to Use the API 🎮

### First Time Setup
1. Start PostgreSQL database
2. Run the application
3. Open Swagger UI (our API playground)

### Testing Steps
1. **Register a New Store**
   - Use the /register endpoint
   - Fill in store information
   - Get back a token

2. **Login**
   - Use the /login endpoint
   - Enter email and password
   - Get a new token

3. **Use Other Features**
   - Click "Authorize" in Swagger
   - Paste your token
   - Now you can:
     - See store information
     - Update information
     - Delete information

## Part 7: Common Terms Explained 🔍

### REST API
- A way to organize our endpoints
- Uses standard HTTP methods:
  - GET: Read information
  - POST: Create new things
  - PUT: Update existing things
  - DELETE: Remove things

### Endpoint
- A URL where you can do something
- Like different counters in a bank:
  - One for deposits
  - One for withdrawals
  - One for information

### JSON
- A way to format information
- Like filling out a form with labels and values
- Example:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "My Store",
    "address": "123 Street"
  }
  ```
