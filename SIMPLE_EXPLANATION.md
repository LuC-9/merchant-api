# Merchant Management System - Simple Explanation 🏪

## What is this project? 🤔

Imagine you have a big box of toy stores (we call them merchants). This project is like a magical notebook that helps you:
- Add new toy stores to your list 📝
- Keep track of all your toy stores 📋
- Make sure only the store owners can see their information 🔒

## How does it work? 🛠️

### 1. The Big Picture 🖼️

Think of it like a three-floor building:
```
   🏰 Top Floor (Controllers)
      Where we talk to people
   
   🏠 Middle Floor (Services)
      Where we do all the work
   
   📦 Ground Floor (Database)
      Where we store everything
```

### 2. What Can We Do? 🎮

#### For New Stores (Like Getting a Library Card)
1. A store owner can sign up (like getting a new library card)
2. They get a special key (like a secret password)
3. They can use this key to do other things

#### For Existing Stores (Using Your Library Card)
- Look at their store information 👀
- Change their store information ✏️
- Remove their store if they want ❌

### 3. How Do We Keep Things Safe? 🔐

- Every store gets a special key (JWT Token)
- It's like a magical bracelet that:
  - Only works for that store
  - Expires after some time
  - Can't be copied by others

### 4. The Parts of Our System 🧩

#### The Front Door (Controllers) 🚪
- Where store owners come to:
  - Register their store
  - Login to their account
  - Make changes to their information

#### The Office (Services) 📊
- Where we:
  - Check if the store information is correct
  - Keep track of all stores
  - Make sure only the right person can see secret information

#### The Storage Room (Database) 📁
- Where we keep:
  - All store information
  - Each store's special number (ID)
  - Store owners' login information

### 5. How Information Flows 🌊

```
1. Store Owner → Makes a Request
   👇
2. Security Guard → Checks their special key
   👇
3. Office Worker → Does the work
   👇
4. Storage Room → Saves or gets information
   👇
5. Back to Store Owner → With what they asked for
```
